A repo for optimizing the addition of tuned mass and tuned inerter dampers into an OC4 Semisubmersible wind turbine. The novelty of the repo comes from its use of symbolic toolboxes to fully solve the Euler-Lagrange equation and simulate the motion of the multibody system. Hence the repo name Symbolic Simulation or SymSim for short.
